# Disaster-Monitoring

The following is a wesbite for the work done on "Using Twitter and Machine Learning for Disaster monitoring".

This website shows the real-time extraction and classification of Tweets and categorizing them into Disaster related and non-related Tweets.

The user has many options to interact with the code. Please find it easy to play with.

Also please use your own Twitter API's and Tokens to access the Developer mode of Twitter for Tweets extraction.

For any query please feel free to ask me.
